# JAMB-Task
Research and Data Collection for all students who have taken JAMB in the last five years

## Investigating The Causes of JAMB Failure Rates and Predicting Future Performance Trends (2020–2030)
Over the past five years, there has been a noticeable increase in the failure rate of students taking the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) examination in Nigeria. This project aims to investigate the root causes of this trend through data-driven research and analysis. We will design and conduct a survey to gather relevant data, explore this data to identify key insights, build a predictive model to forecast success and failure rates over the next five years (2026–2030), and provide actionable recommendations to mitigate future failure rates.
### Visualizations

1. **Overall Pass vs. Fail Count**:
   - **Bar Chart**: Showing the overall count of students who passed versus those who failed the JAMB exam.
   - **Insight**: This visualization provides a clear picture of the overall performance trend, highlighting the number of students who successfully met the cut-off marks versus those who did not.
   - **Visualization**: A bar chart with two bars (one for pass and one for fail) illustrating the overall pass and fail counts.

2. **Distribution of JAMB Scores**:
   - **Histogram**: Showing the frequency of scores in different ranges.
   - **Insight**: The majority of students score between 150 and 250, with a notable peak around 200.
   - **Visualization**: A bar chart displaying the frequency of scores in different ranges, highlighting the concentration of scores around the 200 mark.

3. **Pass Rate by Gender**:
   - **Bar Chart**: Comparing the pass rates of male and female students.
   - **Insight**: Female students show a slightly higher pass rate compared to male students.
   - **Visualization**: A bar chart with two bars (one for male and one for female) illustrating the pass rates, showing a small but noticeable difference.

4. **Yearly Pass Rate Trends**:
   - **Line Graph**: Tracking the pass rate over the years from 2020 to 2025.
   - **Insight**: The trend shows a gradual improvement, indicating that recent cohorts are performing better.
   - **Visualization**: A line graph with years on the x-axis and pass rates on the y-axis, showing an upward trend.

5. **Study Hours and Performance**:
   - **Scatter Plot**: Showing the relationship between study hours and JAMB scores.
   - **Insight**: There is a positive correlation, suggesting that more study hours generally lead to higher scores.
   - **Visualization**: A scatter plot with study hours on the x-axis and JAMB scores on the y-axis, showing a positive trend.

### Conclusion

The EDA provides a comprehensive view of the JAMB UTME landscape, revealing key insights into student performance and the challenges they face. These visualizations bring the data to life, making it easier to understand and interpret. By sharing these insights, we can better inform strategies to improve JAMB performance outcomes and ensure a brighter future for all students.
